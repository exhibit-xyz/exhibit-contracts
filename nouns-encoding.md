### How does Nouns encode their NFT metadata?

(name,des,base64(RLE(SVG)))

`base.tokenURI()` gives you the base64 encoded string on the asset in form `{name, description, base64 { svg }}`

```solidity
struct Seed {
    uint48 background;
    uint48 body;
    uint48 accessory;
    uint48 head;
    uint48 glasses;
}
```

generated by nouns.seed()

if orange is 14 and length 17, we get 14|17

RLE or run-length encoding. RLE('AAABBC') = '3A2B1C'

Each 32x32 image is actually 320x320px
